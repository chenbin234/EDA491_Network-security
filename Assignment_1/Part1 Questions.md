### Q1: Why are higher port numbers (> 1024) still of interest for, e.g., hackers or penetration testers?





### Q2: Look at the resulting packets with Wireshark. What is sent and received? How are the different scans done (what is being sent)? Do the scanned systems behave differently? Why?





### Q3: Some scans take a long time to complete. Why?! Look at the responses from the system and try to explain! (The answer has been mentioned during a lecture.)





### Q4: Nmap can report ports to be in different states. What do the states ”open”, ”closed”, ”filtered” and ”unfiltered” mean? Read the manual page and documentation! Which are the most/least interesting ones? Run a scan against the target systems and try to find examples of all these types of ports. Look at the responses from the system. Can you match the replies with the different states?
