### Q5: When configuring a firewall, the order of the rules is of greatest importance! Why?

This is because the first rule that matches a packet will be applied. 

This means that if a more general rule appears before a more specific rule, the general rule will be applied instead of the more specific rule.

**For example,** let's say we have two rules in the INPUT chain:

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

The first rule allows incoming SSH traffic (on port 22), while the second rule drops all other incoming traffic. However, if we switch the order of the rules, the firewall will drop all incoming traffic, even SSH traffic:

```
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

This is because the second rule, which allows SSH traffic, will never be reached because the first rule matches all incoming traffic and drops it.
