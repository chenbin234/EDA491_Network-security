# Part 2: Confidentiality using TLS



### Q5: What is the reason the verification failed?



### Q6: Once theoden’s identity is correctly verified, the printout should differ slightly: What did you do, and why did this solve the problem?



### Q7: What algorithms are used for key exchange, authentication of server, application message encryption, MAC calculation?





###  Q8: RSA with a sufficient keylength is a strong cipher. Why is RSA not used to encrypt application messages?



### Q9: At this point you should have an established connection: is there anything strange about the TLS output? (Hint: Do not waste too much time here, ask a TA if you do not find anything after a minute or two.)



### Q10: Was the string transmitted successfully? Did you expect this to work? Why or why not?





### Q11: Identify the different TLS messages in Wireshark: which messages are sent? Illustrate your answer with a diagram.





### Q12: Which ciphers are proposed by your client. Where can we find this information?





### Q13: Which cipher is selected by the server? Why is it selected? Where can we find this information?






### Q14: Which TLS message do you think contains the string “TESTMESSAGE”?
