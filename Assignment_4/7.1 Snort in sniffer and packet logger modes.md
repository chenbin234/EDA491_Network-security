# 7.1 Snort in sniffer and packet logger modes



### Q1: To see the string, you had to add the payload option, but when the payload was captured, the output increased in size. Elaborate briefly whether payload data should be captured (consider log sizes, attack coverage, and amount of traffic passing the IDS).





### Q2: Elaborate briefly on storing log files in ASCII and pcap format. When would it be more suitable to store the files in ASCII, and when would it be more suitable to store the files in pcap format? Is there a difference in the way the log files are named?
