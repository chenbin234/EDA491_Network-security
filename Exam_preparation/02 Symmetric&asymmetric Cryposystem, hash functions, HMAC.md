1. Diffie-Hellman key exchange cannot identify the other party, All we know is that we share the secret with someone.

2. It is possible to send IP datagram longer than 65,535 bytes by using fragmentation

3. 



#### 1. Hash function properities

- computationally efficient
- same input always give same output
- Given a hash h, it should be infeasible to find any message m such that h = hash(m)
- collisoion resistance: infeasible to find two different inputs resulting in the same hash
- Any change in the input should result in a new unpredictable hash
