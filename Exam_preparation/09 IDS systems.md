#### 1. TCP segment reassembly can be problematic to an IDS system. Why?

Because the IDS system may not know how the receiving host reassembles overlapping fragments

#### 2. An active IDS system may have a rule that blocks an IP address when it detects that someone is doing a port scan. This may lead to other problems. Explain!

An attacker can fake the IP address in the port scan and thereby cause another user to be blocked.
