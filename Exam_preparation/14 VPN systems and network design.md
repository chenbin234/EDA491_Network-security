#### 1. Zero trust is believed to be the type of architecture we need in the future instead of having just a trditional firewall as defense. Describe the fundamental thoughts behind it.

1. Zero trust focuses on moving protections away from a traditional firewall at the boundary of the company to focus on users, assets and resources.
2. This is needed since resources and users are now moved outside corporate networks.
3. All communication should be secure regardless of network location.
4. The three basic ideas:
   - move protection to the end-points
   - Role-based access control. Access to resources are based on many factors such as roles, location, device being used, etc.
   - End-point security: check devices.
